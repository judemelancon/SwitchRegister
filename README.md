# Switch Register

This is a collection of emoji that are free to use with [attribution](#license).

* All are 128 pixels square. This is the maximum and preferred size for use with [Slack](https://www.slack.com/). It will likely work acceptably with at least some other platforms as well.
* Greyscale emoji were pushed to the narrow band of grey that remains accessibly distinct from both white and black. This makes them intelligible in Slack's regular and dark modes.
* Careful attention was given to transparency and translucency.
* Every PNG emoji was run through [PNGGauntlet](https://pnggauntlet.com/) to minimize file size.

## Structure

The emoji are in the Emoji directory classified into subdirectories to allow partial imports. A Markdown file is present in each directory explaining the sourcing of the emoji in that directory.

The scripts are in the Scripts directory. Their organization will be free form until they are numerous enough to merit further specification.

## Getting Started

Select the emoji you want and add them to your chat system.

A C# upload utility for Slack designed to run as a [LINQPad](https://www.linqpad.net/) script or console application will be provided soon.

## Contributing

Please see [our contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on the process and [our Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  

## License

Distinct licenses are used because the popular ones all define distribution to involve the public and emoji are generally used within an organization or other membership group.

The [actual license](LICENSE.md) is definitive, but a non-binding summary is:
* Before adding emoji, credit the Switch Register project with a link.
* Before executing a script, credit the Switch Register project with a link.
* The other files are CC BY-SA 4.0 because they should be subject only to more typical uses, e.g. cloning, distributing, contributing, and forking.
