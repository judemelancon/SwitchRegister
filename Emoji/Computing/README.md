#### From WorldWideWeb

The [first web browser was written at CERN](https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/) by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Overview.html) then a growing team. It was [initially named WorldWideWeb](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb.html). It was released into the public domain by CERN on April 30, 1993. These icons are from that release. They have been very lightly processed.
