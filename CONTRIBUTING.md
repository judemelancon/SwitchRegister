# Contributing

If you wish to participate in any way, even purely commenting, obey [the code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

All contributions will be subject to [the project's licensing](LICENSE.md).

If you wish to contribute emoji, stick to [acceptable subjects](#acceptable-subjects), maintain the [structure](README.md#structure), and follow [the process](#process).

If you wish to contribute scripts, read about [the process](#process).

## Acceptable Subjects

No emoji will be added that depicts:
* a public figure in an inaccurately negative light,
* a real person other than a public figure (without that person's explicit, verified, project-specific permission),
* any hate speech,
* a symbol of an outright hate group, or
* without the rights holder's explicit, verified, project-specific permission:
    * a trademark or
    * a character originating in a work still under copyright.

The default will be that anything else of possible use is acceptable, but trying cases may result in this list expanding.

## Process

1. If you intend to expend enough effort that you'd be offended by rejection, ask about acceptance first. Opening an issue for this is fine. 
2. Submit a pull request.
    * Pull requests are subject to [the project's licensing](LICENSE.md).
    * The standards for emoji are:
      * Classification is expected and subject to quibbling requests for modification.
      * If sourcing information isn't covered by existing explanations or committed changes, a correcting commit will be requested.
          * If the work is not original, this must provide either
              * explicit project-specific permission of the rights holder or
              * a sound justification for the source being in the public domain.
      * Art style is flexible. This isn't an uniform collection of icons for a cohesive UI.
      * Art quality is subjective. The bar here is approximately to avoid derailing a conversation to the topic of poor emoji quality if one is used.
    * The standards for scripts will be refined if they come up. Some broad guidelines are:
      * Additional scripts relating to Slack or other communications systems would potentially be accepted.
      * Any language that's easy enough to review would potentially be accepted.
        * Even duplicates of existing scripts would potentially be accepted (as an addition, not a replacement). 
3. Wait for it to be approved. This shouldn't take inordinately long.
