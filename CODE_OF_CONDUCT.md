# Code of Conduct

The standard here is to maintain a polite, professional tone while conducting relevant discussions. It does not matter what might be appropriate for a conversation in any other place.

Criticisms of emoji and scripts themselves are definitely germane and are allowed. Generalizing criticisms to the creator of the item is not germane or allowed.

Except to discuss the accuracy of an emoji depicting that person, do not bring up in any way any real or fictional person's:
* age,
* appearance,
* artistic ability,
* disability,
* education,
* ethnicity,
* gender,
* intelligence,
* nationality,
* physical body,
* race,
* religion,
* sex,
* sexual orientation,
* socioeconomic status, or
* talent.

Almost any writing about any person other than the subject of an emoji is irrelevant. _Particularly_ avoid even the suggestion of a personal attack.

Harassment elsewhere is also disallowed.

Suspected violations may be reported to the maintainers.

A first-time non-egregious violation will result in a warning with a reference to this Code of Conduct. Any other violation will result in a block.
 
If someone finds a way to behave badly that isn't covered, this policy will be amended until it is.
